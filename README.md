1: Main Purpose
- Use the TensorFlow platform in deep learning
- Use provided dataset with 2 classes: dog and cat (here) and develop a classifier with deep learning by using the     VGG16 model
- Evaluate the test set results in two metrics: Accuracy and AUC
- To demonstrate how the model is predicted by applying Grad-CAM
- Apply the following augmentations (one by one) method to improve the model's performance and evaluate the results of each: label smoothing, cutmix augmentation, cutout augmentation, and mixup augmentation
